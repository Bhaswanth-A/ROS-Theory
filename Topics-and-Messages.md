# 3. ROS Topics

ROS Topics represent a stream of messages that flow between two or more nodes. Topics are based on the publish/subscribe mechanism, facilitating easy communication between nodes. Before nodes start to transmit data over topics, they must first advertise the topic name and the type of messages to be sent. Then they can publish to the topic. Nodes that want to receive the transmitted messages can subscribe to that topic by making a request to roscore. After subscribing, all the messages on the topic are delivered to the topic that made the request.
In ROS, all messages on the same topic must have the same data type.

## 3.1 Using rostopic

The rostopic command is used to display information about ROS topics that are currently running.

rostopic hz reports the rate at which data is being published. The below image tells us that turtlesim is publishing data about our turtle at the rate of 60 Hz.

# 4. ROS Messages

## 4.1 ROS msg

Message descriptions that flow between nodes are stored as .msg files in the msg subdirectory of a package. There are 2 parts to a .msg file - fields and constants. Fields are the data that is sent inside of the message. Constants are useful values that can be used to interpret those fields.

## 4.2 Creating a ROS msg

![](/Images/msg_1.png)

Now we need to make sure that the msg files are turned into source code for Python, C++, and other languages.
Open *package.xml* and make sure the following lines are uncommented.

```html
<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
<build_export_depend>message_runtime</build_export_depend>
<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>
```
Now we need to make changes to the *CMakeLists.txt* file.

```txt
# Modify the existing text
find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
   roscpp
   rospy
   std_msgs
   message_generation
)
```
```txt
catkin_package(
  ...
  CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
  ...)
```
```txt
add_message_files(
  FILES
  Message1.msg
  Message2.msg
)
```
```txt
generate_messages(
  DEPENDENCIES
  std_msgs
)
```
Now since we have made a few changes to our package and created new files/directories, we need to compile out workspace by running `catkin_make` or `catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps <package_name>`.

The Python script will be created in `~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/beginner_tutorials/msg`.

## 4.4 Publishing to a Topic

```python
#! /usr/bin/python2

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String
import time

rospy.init_node('Node_name',anonymous=True)

pub = rospy.Publisher('/orchis_dark', String, latch=True, queue_size=10)

r = rospy.Rate(10)

while True:
	pub.publish('Current time: {}'.format(time.time()))
	r.sleep()
```
### 4.4.1 Code explanation:

Line 1: `#! /usr/bin/python2` is known as the shebang. It lets the kernel know that this is a Python file and that it should be passed into the Python interpreter.
Line 3: `import rospy` appears in every ROS node and imports some basic functionalities, classes and functions.
Line 4: this line allows us to reuse the `std_msgs/String` message type for publishing.

Line 8: This is used to initialize a ROS node and the node takes the name that you give it. anonymous = True ensures that you have a unique name by adding random numbers to the end of name.
Line 9: pub here is an object of the class Publisher, and allows us to publish to any topic of any message type that you give it. queue_size limits the amount of queued messages if any subscriber is not receiving them fast enough.
Line 11: This line creates an object r of the class Rate. When r.sleep() is called, it sleeps just long enough for the loop to run at the desired rate. When the argument 10 is passed, it goes through the loop 10 times per second.
Line 14: This is used to publish the desired message to the topic.

rostopic hz tells us the rate at which messages are being published. Here we see that it is being published at a rate specified by the argument in rospy.Rate(arg).

## 4.5 Subscribing to a Topic

```python
#! /usr/bin/python2

import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

rospy.init_node('simple_subscriber', anonymous=True)

def function(my_string):
	print(my_string.data)
	
rospy.Subscriber('/force', String, function)

rospy.spin()
```

### 4.5.1 Code explanation:

Line 1: `#! /usr/bin/python2` is known as the shebang. It lets the kernel know that this is a Python file and that it should be passed into the Python interpreter.
Line 3: `import rospy` appears in every ROS node and imports some basic functionalities, classes and functions.

Line 6: This is used to initialize a ROS node and the node takes the name that you give it. anonymous = True ensures that you have a unique name by adding random numbers to the end of name.
Line 8-9: This is a callback function. Once a node has subscribed to a topic, everytime a message arrives on it, the associated callback function is called with the message as itâ€™s parameter.
Line 11: In this line, we subscribe to the topic, giving it the name of the topic, message type and callback function as its arguments.
Line 13: This basically instructs ROS to loop over again, once a subscription has been made.

Behind the scenes, the subscriber passes this information on to roscore and tries to make a direct connection with the publishers of this topic. If the topic does not exist, or if the type is wrong, there are no error messages: the node will simply wait until messages start being published on the topic.
